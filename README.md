# Overview

This program was written because I want to learn Rust. Rust is different from other programming languages and has advantages such as memory management and ownership. This program has allowed me to learn and grow as a programmer

The software I wrote is a password manager. It allows a user to make passwords for sites, remove those passwords, view the passwords, and see how many passwords they have stored.


My purpose for writing this software was mostly to learn Rust and learn how the cargo tool works. It was also to get a better feel for the data structures and how they can be used in Rust.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my environment and the rust extension in it. The Cargo tool comes standard with rust and is used to build the program into a running program. 

I used the Rust programming language to make this program. The only library I used was the std::io library that allows for user input and output through the terminal.

# Future Work

- Permanent password storage through a word file
- Security 
- A nice looking GUI
